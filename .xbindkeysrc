### Rofi as application launcher
# This binding is used along with xcape to launch rofi with a tap
# on the Windows key (Mod4/Super_L):
#
# xcape -e 'Super_L=Menu'
#
# (In my setup, xcape is launched by a disper hook, since it apparently
# needs to be restarted whenever hotplugging a keyboard)
#
# If I had bound Mod4 by itself directly in xbindkeys, the binding would
# interfere with all the other Mod4/Super_L bindings. xcape apparently only
# triggers when tapping the key, not holding it, making the Windows key
# a convenient choice for toggling rofi.
