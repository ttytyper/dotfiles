### Rofi as application launcher
# The setup is a bit complicated, but here goes:
#
# 1. The Windows key by itself is intercepted by xcape (launched by mydisper),
#    which translates it to Windows + d.
# 2. xbindkeys is configured to launch rofi on Windows + d.
# 3. rofi is configured (~/.config/rofi/config.rasi) to cancel out on Windows + d.
#
# All this effectively makes the Windows key by itself act as a rofi toggle. As a fallback,
# in case xcape is not installed, manually pressing Windows + d works as well.
#
# Why involve xcape, can't we just bind to the Windows key itself? Maybe, somehow, but I've
# never gotten it to work, at least not without interfering with other key bindings.
